# brewup

Ease common Homebrew commands

## Install CLI apps

Use [PIPX](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install this package from Github.

```bashpipx install git+https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/natelandau/brewup```

Running the above command will install all script entry points as standalone scripts in the users' PATH.

**Note: You must be authenticated on Github for this to work**

**_Alternative_**
You can install from the local filesystem. This approach will create a link to the _editable version_ of the script which may cause problems if you plan on developing from that directory.

```bash
pipx install ~/path/to/project
```
